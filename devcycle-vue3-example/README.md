# DevCycle JS SDK Example App with Vue.js

An example app built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [DevCycle JS SDK](https://docs.devcycle.com/sdk/client-side-sdks/javascript/)

## Creating a Demo Feature
This example app requires that your project has a feature with the expected variables, as well as some simple targeting rules. 

#### ⇨ [Click here](https://app.devcycle.com/r/create?resource=feature&key=hello-togglebot) to automatically create the feature in your project ⇦

When you run the example app and switch your identity between users, you'll be able to see the feature's different variations.
